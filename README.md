# machine-learning-in-cpp

## Introduction

This is a C++ project that provides Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) functionality for datasets and also implements some basic machine learning (ML) models. The project is designed to help developers with a C++ background to work with datasets and perform basic machine learning tasks without the need for using additional libraries or frameworks.

## Functionality

The project provides the following ETL functionalities:

Extract: The ability to read data from different file formats such as CSV, TSV, and Excel.
Transform: The ability to manipulate the data, such as filtering, sorting, and normalizing.
Load: The ability to store the data in different formats such as CSV, TSV, and databases.

The project also implements some basic machine learning models:

Linear Regression: A statistical approach to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm used for classification based on Bayesâ€™ theorem.
Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Include the necessary header files in your C++ project.
Call the ETL functions to extract, transform, and load data.
Call the ML model functions to train and predict data.

## Conclusion

The C++ ETL and ML project provides a simple yet powerful way to work with datasets and perform basic machine learning tasks without the need for using additional libraries or frameworks. Its documentation and ease of use make it an excellent choice for C++ developers looking to get started with ETL and ML.
